7\. Write a Python program to append a list to the second list.(Using
built-in function and without using built-in function)

8\. Write a Python program to check whether a list contains a sub-list.

9\. Write a Python program to multiplies all the items in a list.

**Sample Input:** lst = \[3, 2, -1, 5, -4\]

**Output :** Multiplication = 120

10\. Write a Python program to check a list is empty or not.

11\. Write a Python program to clone or copy a list.

12\. Write a Python function that takes two lists and returns **True**
if they have at least one common member.(Using SET and without using
SET)

13\. Write a Python program to print the numbers of a specified list
after removing even numbers from it.

14\. Write a Python program to get the difference between the two lists.
(Using SET and without using SET)

**EXAMPLE :**

**Assume below mentioned two lists :**

> a = \[1, 2, 3, 5\]
>
> b = \[1, 2\]

**OUTPUT :**

> lst_diff = \[3, 5\]

15\. Write a Python program to convert a list of characters into a
string.

**Sample Input :** lst = \['P', 'u', 'n', 'e'\]

**Output :** Pune

16\. Write a Python program to find the second largest number in a list.

17\. Write a Python program to find common items from two lists.(Using
SET and without using SET)

**EXAMPLE :**

**Assume below mentioned two lists :**

> a = \[1, 2, 3, 5\]
>
> b = \[1, 2\]

**OUTPUT : Common_items** = \[1,2\]

18\. Write a Python program to insert an element before each element of
a list.

**Sample List:** \['Red', 'Green', 'Black'\]

**Output:** \['C', 'Red', 'C', 'Green', 'C', 'Black'\]

19\. Write a Python program to Interchange First and Last Element of a
List.

**Sample List:** \[1, 29, 51, 7, 23\]

**Expected Output:** \[23, 29, 51,7, 1\]

Q20. Write a Python program to Merge two lists. (Using Built-in function
and without using Built-in functions)

Q21. Write a Python program to check if the given list is in Ascending
Order or not.

Q22. Program to Get Data Items from a List Appearing Odd Number of
Times.

> **Assume** **lst = \[1,2,3,4,5,1,3,3,4\]**
>
> **Expected Output: \[2, 3, 5\]**

Q23. Write a Python program to create a list of tuples with the first
element as the number and second element as the square of the number.

> **Expected Output: \[(1,1),(2,4),(3,9),(4,16)\]**

Q24. Create a list a = \[1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89\] and
write a python program that prints out all the elements of the list
having value less than 5.
